# KYC_and_AML_Data_Analysis

# Project Overview

The major focus of this project revolves around analysis of customer KYC and AML information that can assist financial institutions in identifying potential risks. Currently, the key role of financial institutions is to spot risky customers through large-scale digital banking, and this plays an important role through complying with regulations.
The analysis also provides a data-oriented approach to segmenting customers on the basis of risk levels and understanding the interactions with banking systems and borders.

# Key Objectives

Risk Classification: Classify customers as Low, Medium, and High-risk types based on their KYC information.

Transaction Monitoring: The transactions based upon their nature, channels, amounts, etc., for different ratings.

Geographic & Channel Risk: Detection of high-risk transaction patterns in cross-border transactions and certain channels of banking, like online versus branch transactions.

Compliance Support: Identify areas for increased surveillance for better risk-based decision support and AML compliance.

# Technical Stack

Language: Python

Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy 

Data visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

# Methodology & Insights

The project uses mock customer data, along with PEP and sanctions indicators, and transactions to carry out the following:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Distribution of customer risk tiers and onboarding trends visualization.

Risk-Based Segmentation: High-risk customers were identified to be higher in their international transaction activities and the use of both online and branch banking.

Trend Analysis: Although low-risk customers generate most of the transaction volume (suggesting normal business operation), their higher-risk counterparts demand closer, automated attention.

# Future Work

Implement real-time monitoring and risk scoring.

Expansion of the analysis to encompass other more specific geographic risk indicators.
